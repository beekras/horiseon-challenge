# horiseon-challenge

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to refactor code on the website for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. This makes the code easier to follow and read. As a developer, less code which outputs the same webpage is preferred as it minimises the chance of errors and bugs. 

Deployed application: beekras.github.io/horiseon-challenge

## What was done

    - Title changed to a more professional title
    - All links within webpage now function correctly
    - In order to follow the DRY principle, CSS and HTML was updated accordingly to reduce number of class selectors which all contained same properites 
    - CSS reworked so it follows semantic HTML structure 
    - Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
