# horiseon-challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor code on the website for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. This makes the code easier to follow and read. As a developer, less code which outputs the same webpage is preferred as it minimises the chance of errors and bugs.

Deployed application: <a href="https://beekras.github.io/horiseon-challenge/" target="_blank">beekras.github.io/horiseon-challenge</a>

## What was done

    * Title changed to a more professional title
    * All links within webpage now function correctly
    * In order to follow the DRY principle, CSS and HTML was updated accordingly to reduce number of class selectors which all contained same properites
    * CSS reworked so it follows semantic HTML structure
    * Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes so if an image cannot be displayed due to slow connection or errors in src attributes, there is alternative text for the user to read (1)
